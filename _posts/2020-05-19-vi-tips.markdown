`yiw` – yank the current word (excluding surrounding whitespace)

`yy` or `Y` – yank the current line, including the newline character at the end of the line

`y$` – yank to the end of the current line (but don't yank the newline character); note that many people like to remap Y to y$ in line with C and D

`3yy` - Yank (copy) three lines, starting from the line where the cursor is positioned.

`u:` undo last change (can be repeated to undo preceding commands)

#### How to insert text at beginning of a multi-line selection in vi/Vim

- Press `Esc` to enter 'command mode'
- Use `Ctrl`+`V` to enter visual block mode
- Move `Up`/`Down` to select the columns of text in the lines you want to comment.
- Then hit `Shift`+`i` and type the text you want to insert.
- Then hit `Esc`, wait 1 second and the inserted text will appear on every line.
